# Terraform State Locking with Amazon S3: A New Approach

## Introduction
Terraform uses a **state file** to track infrastructure changes, ensuring consistent deployments. Traditionally, S3 provides reliable storage for this file, while **DynamoDB** enables state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

With **Amazon S3’s new conditional writes feature (introduced on Aug 20, 2024)**, we can now achieve **state locking natively in S3**, eliminating the need for DynamoDB.

---

## Existing S3 Backend Configuration
The traditional approach uses **DynamoDB** for locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "tfstatebucket"
    key            = "locks/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```
How It Works:
-- 
1. S3 stores the state file

2. DynamoDB prevents concurrent writes by acquiring a lock



---

## What's Changing?

Amazon S3 now supports conditional writes, enabling native locking without DynamoDB: Before writing, S3 checks if the file exists.

If it exists, the write is rejected (avoiding conflicts).

If it doesn't exist, the write proceeds.


# Benefits:

✅ No need for DynamoDB

✅ Simplified backend configuration

✅ Improved efficiency with fewer dependencies

### New S3 Backend Configuration

Terraform v1.10.0+ introduces the use_lockfile flag to enable S3 state locking.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "tfstatebucket"
    key          = "locks/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}
```
# Explanation:

use_lockfile = true enables S3-based locking

The .tflock file will be stored in S3 alongside the state file.

---

### Migrating from DynamoDB-Based Locking

For existing configurations using DynamoDB:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "tfstatebucket"
    key            = "locks/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    use_lockfile   = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```
### Steps:

1. Update Terraform backend configuration

2. Run: terraform init -reconfigure

3. Verify that locking now works with S3 (terraform.tfstate.tflock file should appear in the bucket).

4. Remove DynamoDB reference and reinitialize:
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "tfstatebucket"
    key          = "locks/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}
```
---

### Handling Locking Errors

If two users attempt to modify the state file simultaneously, Terraform will throw an error:

```error
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
StatusCode: 412
api error PreconditionFailed: At least one of the pre-conditions you specified did not hold

Terraform prevents conflicts, ensuring state integrity.
```

---

### Provisioning New Infrastructure

For new deployments, simply use:


```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "tfstatebucket"
    key          = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "us-east-1"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true
  }
}
```

# Conclusion

With S3’s native locking, teams can remove DynamoDB, reducing infrastructure complexity while maintaining state integrity.

✅ Simpler backend setup

✅Fewer components to manage

✅ Improved performance and reliability
